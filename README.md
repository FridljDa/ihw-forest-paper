# ihw-forest-paper
This repository serves as companion to the following paper: TODO

All numerical results and figures in the aforementioned paper are made third-party reproducible herein.

We note that the Bioconductor package IHW provides a user-friendly implementation of the IHW-Forest from version TODO.

## Pre-rendered vignettes
TODO 

### **scripts/**
R scripts that run the simulations.
 
### **precomputed_results/**
Simulation results from scripts in the *scripts* directory that have been pre-computed/cached.

### **vignettes/**
R markdown documents that produce the pre-rendered vignettes above upon being compiled (using files saved in the *precomputed_results* folder). The only exception is the vignette for the hQTL data analysis example, which we include as part of the Bioconductor package [IHWpaper](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/IHWpaper).
