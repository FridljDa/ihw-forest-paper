## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
devtools::load_all(here::here("IHWForestPaper/adaptMT"))
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
Xs <- runif(20000, min=0, max=2.5) # covariate
 Hs <- rbinom(20000,1,0.1) # hypothesis true or false
 Zs <- rnorm(20000, Xs*Hs) # Z-score
 Ps <- 1-pnorm(Zs) # pvalue
 Xs <- cbind(Xs, Xs)
 adapt_xgboost_wrapper(Ps, Xs)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
