This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
covariate <- runif(100)
nbins <- 5
```


```{r}
rfs <- rank(covariate, ties.method="random")/length(covariate)
as.factor(ceiling(rfs* nbins))
```

```{r}
breaks <- quantile(covariate, probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = nbins+1))
cut(covariate, breaks=breaks, include.lowest=TRUE)
```

```{r}
ranks_cov <- rank(covariate, ties.method="random")
rfs <- ceiling(ranks_cov* nbins/length(covariate))
cut(covariate, breaks=breaks, include.lowest=TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
